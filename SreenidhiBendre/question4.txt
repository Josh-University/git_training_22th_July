- deleting single or multiple commit

1. using git rebase:
	```git rebase -i HEAD~N```
	replace pick with d(drop) to drop that commit
2. using git reset with commit id:
	```git reset --HARD [commit_id]```
	deletes all the commits after commit_id. the HEAD now points to commit_id
3. using git reset with head:
	```git reset HEAD~N```
	resets the head to Nth previous commit
