To delete a commit or unstage the staged changes, we use revert,soft reset,hard reset.
With revert we specify the reference id of the commit we want to delete and also the number of commits before it after tild. git revert ref_id ~count. Data is also deleted upto previous commit and log file has a log about revert.
With soft reset, only staged changes are unstaged thus only deleting the commit, commit from log file is also deleted, data is not deleted. git reset --soft ref_id ~count. 
With hard reset, only staged changes are unstaged thus deleting the commit, commit from log file is also deleted, data is deleted upto previous commit. git reset --hard ref_id ~count.
