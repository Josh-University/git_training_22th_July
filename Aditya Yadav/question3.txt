To combine two or more commits into one we use interactive rebase mode.
The command is 'git rebase -i HEAD~3' where head is reference to the commit(another reference id can also be used) and figures after ~ indicate the number of commits to be combined before reference.
Once we rebase the commits over current head, we add squash to two or more commits we want to combine and then we exit the prompt which executes the command.
