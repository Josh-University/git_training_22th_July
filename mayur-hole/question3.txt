Answer 3:

If you're currently on your "commit 1", and the commit you want to merge, "commit 2", is the previous commit, you can run git rebase -i HEAD~2, which will spawn an editor listing all the commits the rebase will traverse. 
You should see two lines starting with "pick". To proceed with squashing, change the first word of the second line from "pick" to "squash". 
We can also use just 's' instead of squash
Then save your file, and quit. 
Git will squash your first commit into your second last commit.
