Lets suppose I made some chnages in a file in my local storage.Now if I push the file,but if someone has already made some changes, then I wont be able to push my chnages.
I will have to pull again.
So to directly overwrite the files at the repo, I will use --force push command.
It will remove all the previous changes and put all the files on my local to the repo.
It is not recommeneded.
