1. Checked git log.
2. Merged two commits.
3. Used "git push <repoName> <branchName>" - this was rejected because history was changed.
4. To use --force-with-lease, used "git push --force-with-lease <repoName> <branchName>".
5. To use --force, used "git push --force <repoName> <branchName>".

Difference:
--force changes the content in remote branch. It overwrites the remote branch with the changes on local branch.

--force-with-lease does not overwrites the changes on remote branch.

Usage:
1. We can use --force when we do not worry about the newly done commits on remote branch, so that the overlapping of history won't matter.
2.
