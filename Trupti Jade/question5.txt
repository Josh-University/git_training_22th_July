Difference between --force and --force-with-lease :
git push --force changes the content in remote branch. It overwrites the remote branch with the changes on local branch.
git push --force-with-lease does not overwrites the changes on remote branch.

When to Use Force with Lease :
1.It is recommended always to use --force-with-lease over --force.
2.Pushing the changes with lease helps us avoid discarding changes pushed by other developers.
