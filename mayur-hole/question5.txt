What does force push do?
The --force option for git push allows you to override this rule: the commit history on the remote will be forcefully overwritten with your own local history. 
This is a rather dangerous process, because it's very easy to overwrite (and thereby lose) commits from your colleagues.

When to use force push-
Things got messy, but the working version in your local machine is the one that should be going forward â€” you know it, and your team knows it. 
If you want to prioritize your local branch over the remote one, overwriting any commits made along the way, then by all means go for it.

Revert changes made by force push-
Simply run git push --force origin last-good-commit:main to restore everything as it was.

git push --force



Force with lease:
It is recommended always to use --force-with-lease over --force

git push --force-with-lease

--force-with-lease is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch (by another team-member or coworker or what have you). 
It ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.
