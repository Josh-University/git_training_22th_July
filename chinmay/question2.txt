We can set multiple repos for the same project by changing the name of the origin while connecting the remote to local.
When we commit any changes in any of the file in local, while pushing we have to specify the origin name. 
The committed changes will be pushed to that particular repo only.

USe case:
When the project has very complex structure and number of people working on the project are high then the project must have multiple repos.
