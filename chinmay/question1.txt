Cherry-pick is basically a process to pick a commit from certain branch and paste it in another branch.
A copy of commit is created on another branch.
 
Use cases: If the commits are made on the wrong branch by mistake then the developer can cherry pick the commit from that branch and paste it in his/her working branch. After this the commit from wrongly
pasted branch can be revoked. 

Steps:
Suppose there is one feature "feature-login" branch apart from main branch

1. Checkout to main branch
   git checkout master
2. Apply cherry pick on required commit of feature branch
   git cherry-pick "#commit reference"

This will create a copy of that particular commit and paste it in master branch.
