Cherry Pick-
Cherry pick is basically a command in git which let's us bring changes of a specific commit from one branch into another branch.
We can pick one or more specific commits using their commit id's.


Use case of cherry pick-
Suppose we are working on a main branch and accidently we shifted to any other branch and made some of the commits in it.
So now we will have to merge the branch in main branch, but we don't want all the commits of that branch in main branch, in 
this case we will use cherry pick to take only the specific commit of that branch into the main branch.

Steps of cherry pick-
1. Make changes in a file in some other branch and commit. 
2. Switch to your branch.
3. Execute command  "git cherry-pick <commitId>".
4. Testing for cherry pick.    //Line added from another commit in some other branch.
