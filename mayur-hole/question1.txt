Answer 1:

Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch. 
In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. 
You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.

Suppose you are working with a team of developers on a medium to large-sized project. 
Some changes proposed by another team member and you want to apply some of them to your main project, not all. 
Since managing the changes between several Git branches can become a complex task, and you don't want to merge a whole branch into another branch. 
You only need to pick one or two specific commits. 
To pick some changes into your main project branch from other branches is called cherry-picking.

Scenerio1: Accidently make a commit in a wrong branch.
Scenario2: Make the changes proposed by another team member.
