We can add multiple remote repositories in a same project using the following syntax:
1.Create a remote Repository in your Git account.
2.Execute-git remote add <remoteRepo_name> <remoteRepo_url> in your local system.

Use case-
We use remote repositories because it saves our local disk space. Also, we use it when
we want to share our code to the team for project purposes.
