To combine two or more than two commits into one we use the command git rebase -i HEAD~""quantity.
After this command execution, a terminal opens,lets say we want to merge the 3rd and 4th commit with the 2nd commit, we will set the 3rd and 4th as S and 2nd as pick.
The ref_id of the merged commit will be completely different.
