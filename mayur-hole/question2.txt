Answer 2:

If you are working on a big project, then it is inevitable that you need to work with multiple repositories.

That’s why you need to sync your local code base with multiple Git remote repositories.

For example, if your source code is:
On Github for issues tracking
On Heroku for production
On Some Other Git repo

Using git this way is actually quite simple.
 You add remotes in the same way that you would push an existing folder, except instead of adding the “origin” remote, you give it a different name.

git remote add <name> <url>
Then, when you want to push to the second remote, add the remote name and branch to your push command:

git push second master
