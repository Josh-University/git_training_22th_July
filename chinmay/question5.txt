git push --force does not check for the any differences in remote and the local files.
It directly overwrites the the remote file with the local file.

git push --force-with-lease whereas do not overwrite the remote repo. It checks the logs and update the differences.
Suppose there are different commits on remote repo. But the user merge commits in his local and tries to push, the difference is noted and is not allowed to push.
But actually there is no change in the data just the commits are merged. In this case --force-with-lease is used so that the merged commits are updated on remote.
